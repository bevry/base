## History

- v1.3.9 November 17, 2013
  - `CONTRIBUTING.md`: Better structure and more informative

- v1.3.8 November 7, 2013
  - `Cakefile`: will now install DocPad dev dependencies if we are using DocPad
  - `.travis.yml`: `cake install` is now explicitly part of the install process, rather than implied in the test process
  - Fixes compatibility with DocPad plugins
    - DocPad plugins still need to define DocPad in `peerDependencies` and `devDependencies`

- v1.3.7 November 1, 2013
  - `cyclic.js`: wrapped in self executing closure to prevent global leaks

- v1.3.6 November 1, 2013
  - `cyclic.js`: don't force install ourselves, if we've already done it previously

- v1.3.5 October 31, 2013
  - `.gitignore`: added `out`

- v1.3.4 October 26, 2013
  - `Cakefile`: push up master and tags after publish

- v1.3.3 October 26, 2013
  - `.npmignore`: fixed typo

- v1.3.2 October 26, 2013
  - `.travis.yml`: fixed

- v1.3.1 October 26, 2013
  - Tags should be annotated
  - Don't fail install if test directory is not found

- v1.3.0 October 26, 2013
  - As the npm package scripts only works on windows, instead lets take the good bits from both solutions

- v1.2.0 October 25, 2013
  - Abandoned the Cakefile setup for npm package scripts

- v1.1.3 October 2, 2013
  - Don't use the `bare` option to compile coffeescript, it pollutes the global namespace

- v1.1.2 September 2, 2013
  - Fixed status codes not being taken into account
  - `safe` now supports only one argument

- v1.1.1 June 25, 2013
